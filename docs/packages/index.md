    The documentation in this guide needs to be reviewed and updated.

Welcome to the Packages documentation! This section provides comprehensive information about available packages and how to use them in your Microsoft Fabric projects.

## What are Packages?

Packages are reusable workload extensions that provide specialized functionality for common data processing scenarios in Microsoft Fabric. Each package includes:

- **Pre-built templates** - Ready-to-use notebook templates and configurations
- **Processing logic** - Optimized code for specific data workflows
- **Configuration schemas** - Standardized configuration formats
- **Sample data and examples** - Complete working examples to get started quickly
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and API references

## How Packages Work

    B --> C[Compilation]
    C --> D[Generated Notebooks]
    D --> E[Fabric Deployment]
    E --> F[Execution]
```

### Package Lifecycle

1. **Template Definition** - Packages are defined using Jinja2 templates with configurable parameters
2. **Configuration** - Users provide environment-specific configuration via JSON or CLI parameters
3. **Compilation** - The CLI compiles templates into executable Fabric notebooks
4. **Deployment** - Generated notebooks are deployed to your Fabric workspace
5. **Execution** - Notebooks run in Fabric with full logging and error handling

### CLI Commands

All packages follow consistent CLI patterns:

```bash
# Compile a package (generates notebooks)
ingen_fab package <package-name> compile [OPTIONS]

# Run a package (executes the workflow)
ingen_fab package <package-name> run [OPTIONS]

# List available configurations
ingen_fab package <package-name> list [OPTIONS]
```

## Available Packages

### Data Ingestion

#### [Flat File Ingestion](flat_file_ingestion.md)
Automated ingestion of various file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro, XML) into Delta tables with configuration-driven metadata management.

**Use Cases:**
- Batch file processing from data lakes
- Automated data pipeline ingestion
- Multi-format data standardization
- Data validation and quality checks

**Supported Targets:** Lakehouse, Warehouse

---

### Data Generation

#### [Synthetic Data Generation](synthetic_data_generation.md)
Generate realistic synthetic datasets for testing, development, and prototyping with configurable patterns and relationships.

**Use Cases:**
- Test data generation for development
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- Data masking and privacy-safe datasets
- Prototype development without production data

**Supported Patterns:** Retail, Finance, Healthcare, Custom

---

### Data Export

#### [Extract Generation](extract_generation.md)
Orchestrated data extract generation from Fabric warehouses and lakehouses with configurable scheduling and multiple output formats.

**Use Cases:**
- Data warehouse to data lake exports
- Scheduled data extracts for external systems
- Multi-format data distribution
- Data archival and backup workflows

**Supported Formats:** CSV, Parquet, JSON, Delta

---

### Data Synchronization

#### [Synapse Sync](synapse_sync.md)
Bidirectional data synchronization between Microsoft Fabric and Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces.

**Use Cases:**
- Migrating from Synapse to Fabric
- Hybrid Synapse-Fabric architectures
- Data replication and backup
- Cross-platform analytics workflows

**Sync Modes:** Full, Incremental, Bidirectional

## Package Development

### Creating Custom Packages

Want to build your own package? Learn about the package development process:

1. **[Package Architecture](../developer_guide/packages.md)** - Understanding the package system
2. **[Template Development](../developer_guide/ddl_scripts.md)** - Creating Jinja2 templates
3. **[Python Libraries](../developer_guide/python_libraries.md)** - Using shared utilities
4. **[Testing Packages](../developer_guide/python_libraries.md#testing)** - Local and platform testing

### Package Standards

All packages follow these standards:

- **Consistent CLI interface** - Same command patterns across all packages
- **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed execution logs and error handling
- **Environment isolation** - Configuration-driven behavior without code changes
- **Testing support** - Local testing capabilities before Fabric deployment
- **Documentation** - Complete usage guides and examples

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Workflow

1. **Choose a package** from the list above based on your use case
2. **Review the documentation** for configuration options and examples
3. **Compile the package** with your configuration:
   ```bash
   ingen_fab package <package-name> compile --include-samples
   ```
4. **Deploy to Fabric** using the standard deployment workflow:
   ```bash
   ingen_fab deploy deploy
   ```
5. **Execute the notebooks** in your Fabric workspace

### Best Practices

- **Start with samples** - Use `--include-samples` to get working examples
- **Test locally first** - Use local testing before Fabric deployment
- **Version your configurations** - Keep package configurations in source control
- **Monitor execution** - Review notebook logs for performance and errors
- **Customize gradually** - Start with defaults, then customize for your needs
